# Test Stainless Automation

This document provides steps to test the Stainless SDK automation setup.

## ✅ Current Status

All automation components are now configured and ready:

- ✅ **GitHub Workflow**: `.github/workflows/stainless.yml` 
- ✅ **Secret Configuration**: `STAINLESS_TOKEN` from AWS environment
- ✅ **OpenAPI Validation**: All 4 new auth endpoints documented
- ✅ **Stainless Config**: `stainless.yml` with TypeScript and Python targets
- ✅ **Workspace File**: `stainless-workspace.json` properly configured

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Test Preview Build (Recommended)

Create a test PR with a small OpenAPI change:

```bash
# Make a small test change to trigger build
git checkout -b test-stainless-automation
echo '    # Test comment for Stainless automation' >> docs/openapi.json
git add docs/openapi.json
git commit -m "test: trigger Stainless preview build"
git push origin test-stainless-automation
```

Then create a PR from this branch. Expected result:
- ✅ Stainless bot comments on PR with build results
- ✅ Links to preview SDK packages
- ✅ Build diagnostics and validation results

### 2. Test Production Build

After verifying the preview works:
- Merge the test PR to `main`
- Expected result:
  - ✅ Production SDK build triggers
  - ✅ Updated packages pushed to staging repositories
  - ✅ Build appears in Stainless dashboard

### 3. Rollback Test Changes

Clean up the test:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Remove the test comment from OpenAPI spec if needed
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If builds don't trigger:

1. **Check Workflow File**: Ensure paths match exactly:
   - `docs/openapi.json` 
   - `stainless.yml`

2. **Verify Secret**: Confirm `STAINLESS_TOKEN` is available in GitHub Actions

3. **Check File Changes**: Ensure PR actually modifies monitored files

4. **Review Permissions**: Workflow needs `pull-requests: write` for comments

## 📊 Expected Output

### Preview Build PR Comment Example:
```
🤖 Stainless SDK Preview

✅ Build completed successfully!

📦 Preview Packages:
- TypeScript: Download preview or install with npm install [preview-link]
- Python: pip install [preview-link]

🔍 Diagnostics:
- No errors found
- 4 new authentication endpoints detected
- Compatible with existing SDK structure

📈 Changes:
- Tool auth: POST /tools/{toolId}/auth
- OAuth login: GET /auth/{toolKey}/login  
- OAuth callback: GET /auth/{toolKey}/callback
- Action execution: POST /actions/{key}/execute

```

### Production Build Success:
- GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
- Stainless dashboard shows completed build
- SDK repositories updated with new version

## 🎯 Ready for Production

The automation is fully configured and ready to:

1. **Monitor Changes**: Automatically detect OpenAPI spec modifications
2. **Generate Previews**: Provide SDK previews on every relevant PR  
3. **Build Production**: Auto-build and publish SDKs on merge
4. **Maintain Quality**: Validate specs and provide diagnostics

**Next Action**: Create a test PR to validate the full automation pipeline! 🚀
