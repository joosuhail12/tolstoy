## Execution Usage

Understanding how executions are counted:

### What Counts as an Execution?
- Each time a workflow runs completely = 1 execution

- Scheduled workflows that trigger = 1 execution
- Webhook-triggered workflows = 1 execution

### What Doesn't Count?
- Workflow testing during development
- Syntax validation and error checking
- Saving workflow configurations
- Viewing analytics and logs

### Step Limits
All plans include unlimited steps per workflow. Only complete workflow executions are counted toward your monthly limit.
