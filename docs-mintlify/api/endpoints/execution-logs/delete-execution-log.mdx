## Overview

The Delete Execution Log endpoint removes an execution log entry from the system. Use this endpoint with caution as it permanently removes audit trail information and cannot be undone.

## Authentication

<ParamField header="x-org-id" type="string" required>
  Organization ID for multi-tenant access control
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="x-user-id" type="string" required>
  User ID of the requesting user for authorization
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Bearer token for API authentication
</ParamField>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier of the execution log to delete
</ParamField>

## Response

**Status Code:** `204 No Content`

The endpoint returns an empty response body with a 204 status code when the deletion is successful.

## Usage Examples

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.tolstoy.com/v1/execution-logs/log_def456" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Org-ID: org_123456" \
  -H "X-User-ID: user_789012"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const deleteResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/execution-logs/log_def456', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiToken}`,
    'X-Org-ID': 'org_123456',
    'X-User-ID': 'user_789012'
  }
});

if (deleteResponse.status === 204) {
  console.log('Execution log deleted successfully');
} else if (deleteResponse.status === 409) {
  const error = await deleteResponse.json();
  console.error('Cannot delete log:', error.message);
} else {
  console.error('Deletion failed:', deleteResponse.status);
}
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.delete(
    "https://api.tolstoy.com/v1/execution-logs/log_def456",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}",
        "X-Org-ID": "org_123456",
        "X-User-ID": "user_789012"
    }
)

if response.status_code == 204:
    print("Execution log deleted successfully")
elif response.status_code == 409:
    error = response.json()
    print(f"Cannot delete log: {error['message']}")
else:
    print(f"Deletion failed: {response.status_code}")
```

## Deletion Restrictions

### Active Executions
Cannot delete logs for executions that are currently:
- `running` - Execution is in progress
- `pending` - Execution is queued to start
- `canceling` - Execution is being canceled

### Permission Requirements
Deletion requires elevated permissions:
- **Admin role**: Can delete any execution log in organization
- **Member role**: Can delete logs from own executions only
- **Viewer role**: Cannot delete execution logs

### Audit Trail Considerations
Before deleting execution logs, consider:
- **Compliance requirements**: May need to retain logs for regulatory compliance
- **Debugging needs**: Logs may be needed for future troubleshooting
- **Analytics**: Historical data may be valuable for performance analysis

## Bulk Deletion

For bulk deletion of execution logs, consider these approaches:

### Delete by Execution
```javascript
// Get all logs for a specific execution
const logs = await fetch(`/api/v1/execution-logs?executionId=${executionId}`);
const logData = await logs.json();

// Delete each log entry
const deletePromises = logData.logs.map(log => 
  fetch(`/api/v1/execution-logs/${log.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' })
);

await Promise.all(deletePromises);
```

### Delete by Date Range
```javascript
// Get logs older than specified date
const cutoffDate = new Date();
cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - 30); // 30 days ago

const oldLogs = await fetch(
  `/api/v1/execution-logs?createdBefore=${cutoffDate.toISOString()}`
);
const oldLogData = await oldLogs.json();

// Delete old logs
for (const log of oldLogData.logs) {
  await fetch(`/api/v1/execution-logs/${log.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
}
```

## Safety Measures

### Pre-deletion Checks
Before deletion, the system verifies:
1. **Execution Status**: Ensures execution is not active
2. **User Permissions**: Validates user can delete logs
3. **Retention Policies**: Checks if log must be retained
4. **Dependencies**: Ensures no other systems depend on the log

### Soft Delete Option
Consider implementing soft delete for better safety:
```javascript
// Instead of DELETE, use PUT to mark as deleted
await fetch(`/api/v1/execution-logs/${logId}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    metadata: { 
      deleted: true, 
      deletedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      deletedBy: userId 
    }
  })
});
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Archiving
Instead of deletion, consider archiving old logs:
```javascript
// Move logs to archive storage
await fetch(`/api/v1/execution-logs/${logId}/archive`, {
  method: 'POST'
});
```

### Retention Policies
Implement automatic cleanup based on policies:
```javascript
// Set retention policy for execution logs
await fetch('/api/v1/organizations/settings', {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    executionLogRetention: {
      maxAgeDays: 90,
      maxCount: 10000,
      autoCleanup: true
    }
  })
});
```

## Audit Logging

Deletion operations are logged in the audit trail:
- **User**: Who performed the deletion
- **Timestamp**: When the deletion occurred
- **Log Details**: Information about the deleted log
- **Reason**: Why the log was deleted (if provided)

## Recovery

Once deleted, execution logs cannot be recovered through the API. However:
- **Database backups**: May contain deleted logs
- **Archive systems**: Logs may be archived before deletion
- **External logging**: Logs may exist in external systems

## Use Cases

### Cleanup Operations
- Remove logs from test executions
- Clean up failed workflow attempts
- Archive old execution data

### Data Management
- Comply with data retention policies
- Reduce storage costs
- Maintain database performance

### Privacy Requirements
- Remove logs containing sensitive data
- Comply with data deletion requests
- Clean up deprecated workflows

## Best Practices

1. **Verify Before Deletion**: Always confirm log is no longer needed
2. **Backup First**: Consider backing up logs before deletion
3. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure no other processes depend on the log
4. **Document Reasons**: Log why deletion was performed
5. **Batch Operations**: Use bulk deletion for efficiency
