## Deletion Process

The organization deletion follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: Verify user permissions and resolve dependencies
2. **Backup Creation**: Generate backup if requested
3. **Data Export**: Export critical data for compliance
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Delete workflows, executions, and connections
5. **User Removal**: Remove users from organization (users remain in system)
6. **Billing Cancellation**: Cancel subscriptions and process final billing
7. **Final Cleanup**: Remove organization record and associated metadata

## Pre-Deletion Checklist

Before deleting an organization, ensure:

- [ ] All active workflows are stopped
- [ ] Important data is exported or backed up
- [ ] Users are notified of the deletion
- [ ] Billing subscriptions are reviewed
- [ ] API integrations are updated to remove organization references

## Data Retention

After deletion:
- **Immediate**: Organization becomes inaccessible
- **7 Days**: Backup files remain downloadable
- **30 Days**: Audit logs retained for compliance
- **90 Days**: Anonymized usage data retained for analytics

## Webhook Events

The deletion process triggers several webhook events:
- `organization.deletion_started` - When deletion begins
- `organization.backup_created` - When backup is completed (if requested)
- `organization.deletion_completed` - When deletion finishes
- `organization.deletion_failed` - If deletion encounters errors

## Recovery Options

Once deleted, an organization cannot be recovered. However:
- Users remain in the system and can join new organizations
- Backups (if created) contain exportable data
- Some anonymized analytics data is retained
