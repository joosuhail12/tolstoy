## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Key Metrics to Monitor

```sql
-- Database health metrics query
WITH db_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        -- Connection metrics
        (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) as total_connections,
        (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active') as active_connections,
        (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'idle') as idle_connections,
        
        -- Performance metrics
        (SELECT sum(blks_hit) FROM pg_stat_database) as cache_hits,
        (SELECT sum(blks_read) FROM pg_stat_database) as cache_misses,
        
        -- Transaction metrics
        (SELECT sum(xact_commit) FROM pg_stat_database) as commits,
        (SELECT sum(xact_rollback) FROM pg_stat_database) as rollbacks,
        
        -- Size metrics
        (SELECT pg_database_size(current_database())) as db_size,
        
        -- WAL metrics
        (SELECT pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), '0/0')) as wal_bytes
),
calculated_metrics AS (
    SELECT *,
        CASE 
            WHEN (cache_hits + cache_misses) > 0 
            THEN (cache_hits::float / (cache_hits + cache_misses) * 100)::numeric(5,2)
            ELSE 0 
        END as cache_hit_ratio,
        CASE
            WHEN (commits + rollbacks) > 0
            THEN (rollbacks::float / (commits + rollbacks) * 100)::numeric(5,2)
            ELSE 0
        END as rollback_ratio
    FROM db_stats
)
SELECT 
    total_connections,

### 2. Alerting Rules

```yaml
# Prometheus alerting rules for PostgreSQL

  - name: postgresql
    rules:
      - alert: PostgreSQLDown
        expr: pg_up == 0

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="High CPU Usage">
    **Diagnosis:**
    ```sql
    -- Find CPU-intensive queries
    SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    WHERE mean_time > 1000  -- queries taking > 1 second on average
    ORDER BY total_time DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    
    -- Check for table scans
    SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, seq_tup_read
    FROM pg_stat_user_tables
    WHERE seq_scan > 1000
    ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;
    ```
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Add missing indexes for frequently scanned tables
    - Optimize slow queries identified above
    - Consider partitioning large tables
    - Increase work_mem for complex queries
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Memory Usage">
    **Diagnosis:**
    ```sql
    -- Check memory usage by connection
    SELECT pid, usename, application_name, state,
           backend_start,
           now() - backend_start as connection_age
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    ORDER BY backend_start
    LIMIT 20;
    
    -- Check for large result sets
    SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, rows/calls as avg_rows_per_call
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    WHERE rows/calls > 10000
    ORDER BY rows DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Reduce shared_buffers if over-allocated
    - Lower work_mem for individual connections
    - Implement result set pagination
    - Close idle connections
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Lock Contention">
    **Diagnosis:**
    ```sql
    -- Active locks and waiting queries
    SELECT 
        blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
        blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
        blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
        blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
        blocked_activity.query AS blocked_statement,
        blocking_activity.query AS current_statement_in_blocking_process,
        blocked_activity.application_name AS blocked_application,
        blocking_activity.application_name AS blocking_application
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks 
        ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
        AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
        AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
        AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
        AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
        AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
        AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
        AND blocking_locks.classid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.classid
        AND blocking_locks.objid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objid
        AND blocking_locks.objsubid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.objsubid
        AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
    WHERE NOT blocked_locks.GRANTED;
    ```
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Identify and optimize long-running transactions
    - Consider reducing transaction scope
    - Use appropriate isolation levels
    - Implement application-level locking strategies

## Security Operations

### 1. User Management

```sql
-- Create read-only user for monitoring
CREATE USER monitoring_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE tolstoy_prod TO monitoring_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO monitoring_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO monitoring_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO monitoring_user;

-- Create backup user
CREATE USER backup_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_backup_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE tolstoy_prod TO backup_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO backup_user;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO backup_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO backup_user;

-- Regular security audit
SELECT usename, usesuper, usecreatedb, usebypassrls, 
       usecanlogin, useconnlimit, valuntil
FROM pg_user
ORDER BY usename;
```

### 2. Audit and Compliance

```sql
-- Enable audit logging (pgaudit extension)
ALTER SYSTEM SET pgaudit.log = 'ddl, dml, misc';
ALTER SYSTEM SET pgaudit.log_catalog = off;
ALTER SYSTEM SET pgaudit.log_parameter = on;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Query audit logs
SELECT session_id, command_tag, object_type, object_name, statement
FROM audit.audit_log
WHERE event_time >= now() - interval '1 day'
  AND command_tag IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')
ORDER BY event_time DESC;
```
