## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Application-Level Optimizations

#### Caching Strategy
```yaml
caching_layers:
  l1_cache: # Application memory cache
    technology: "Node.js Map/WeakMap"
    ttl: "5 minutes"
    max_size: "500MB per service"
    use_cases:
      - "frequently accessed workflows"
      - "user session data"
      - "integration configurations"
      
  l2_cache: # Distributed cache
    technology: "Redis Cluster"
    ttl: "1 hour"
    max_size: "8GB"
    use_cases:
      - "workflow execution results"
      - "API response caching"
      - "computed aggregations"
      
  l3_cache: # Database query cache
    technology: "PostgreSQL shared_buffers"
    size: "16GB"
    use_cases:
      - "frequently executed queries"
      - "lookup table data"
      - "metadata caching"
      
cache_invalidation:
  workflow_updates: "immediate"
  user_changes: "immediate"
  organization_settings: "5 minute delay"
  statistics: "1 hour delay"
```

#### Connection Pool Optimization
```yaml
connection_pool_tuning:
  database_pools:
    pool_size: 50
    max_overflow: 20
    pool_timeout: 30
    pool_recycle: 3600
    pool_pre_ping: true

    max_connections_per_host: 100
    max_total_connections: 1000
    connection_timeout: 10
    read_timeout: 30
    keep_alive: true
    
  redis_connections:
    pool_size: 20
    connection_timeout: 5
    socket_timeout: 30
    retry_attempts: 3
```

#### Database Query Optimization
```sql
-- High-impact query optimizations
-- 1. Workflow listing with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_workflows_org_status_created 
ON workflows(organization_id, status, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- 2. Execution monitoring queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_executions_workflow_status_started
ON executions(workflow_id, status, started_at DESC);

-- 3. Integration health queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_integration_logs_integration_created
ON integration_logs(integration_id, created_at DESC);

-- 4. User activity queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_audit_logs_user_created
ON audit_logs(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Materialized views for expensive aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW workflow_statistics AS
SELECT 
    organization_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_workflows,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active_workflows,
    AVG(execution_count) as avg_executions,
    MAX(updated_at) as last_activity
FROM workflows 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY organization_id;

-- Refresh strategy
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_workflow_statistics()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY workflow_statistics;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule refresh every 15 minutes
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-workflow-stats', '*/15 * * * *', 'SELECT refresh_workflow_statistics();');
```

#### Load Test Scripts
```javascript

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```yaml
performance_monitoring:
  real_time_dashboards:
    - "API Response Times by Endpoint"
    - "Workflow Execution Metrics"
    - "Database Query Performance"
    - "Integration Service Health"
    - "Resource Utilization Trends"
    
  alerting_rules:
    response_time_degradation:
      condition: "p95_response_time > 300ms for 5 minutes"
      severity: "warning"
      
    error_rate_spike:
      condition: "error_rate > 1% for 2 minutes"
      severity: "critical"
      
    resource_exhaustion:
      condition: "memory_usage > 90% for 5 minutes"
      severity: "critical"
      
  performance_reports:
    frequency: "daily"
    metrics:
      - "API performance summary"
      - "Workflow execution statistics"
      - "Resource utilization trends"
      - "Capacity planning recommendations"
```
