   npm install
   
   # Install CLI dependencies
   cd cli && npm install && cd ..
   
   # Install SDK dependencies  
   cd sdk && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. **Set up local environment**:

   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Configure local database
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis
   
   # Run database migrations
   npm run db:migrate
   
   # Seed development data
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

**Afternoon (2-3 hours)**
- **Buddy Meeting**: Meet with your assigned buddy for a codebase walkthrough
- **Architecture Overview**: Read [System Architecture](/internal/architecture/system-overview)
- **Code Tour**: Explore the main directories and understand the project structure

### Days 2-3: Understanding Core Concepts

**Key Areas to Study**:

1. **Flow Engine** (`src/flows/`):
   ```typescript
   // Understand how workflows are executed
   class FlowEngine {
     async executeFlow(flow: Flow, context: ExecutionContext) {
       // Study the execution logic
       // Understand step processing
       // Learn error handling patterns
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Action Registry** (`src/actions/`):
   ```typescript
   // Learn how actions are registered and executed
   class ActionRegistry {
     private actions: Map<string, ActionDefinition> = new Map();
     
     async executeAction(actionKey: string, inputs: any) {
       // Study action execution
       // Understand input validation
       // Learn output mapping
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Tool Integration** (`src/tools/`):
   ```typescript
   // Understand how external services are integrated
   interface ToolDefinition {
     name: string;
     baseUrl: string;
     authType: 'api_key' | 'oauth' | 'bearer';
     // Study authentication patterns
   }
   ```

**Reading List**:
- [Flow Definition System](/internal/features/flows/definition-system)
- [Action Registry Architecture](/internal/features/actions/action-registry)
- [Tool Integration System](/internal/features/tools/integration-system)
- [API Design Principles](/internal/development/guidelines/api-design-principles)

### Days 4-5: First Code Changes

**Small Starter Tasks** (choose 1-2):

1. **Add a new validation rule**:
   - File: `src/common/services/input-validator.service.ts`
   - Add validation for email format or URL validation
   - Write unit tests for your validation

2. **Improve error messages**:
   - File: `src/common/exceptions/`
   - Make error messages more descriptive
   - Add error codes for better debugging

3. **Add logging to a service**:
   - Choose any service in `src/`
   - Add structured logging using our logging service
   - Follow the [Logging Guidelines](/internal/development/patterns/service-patterns)

**Code Review Process**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-name/task-description`
2. Make your changes with proper tests
3. Run the test suite: `npm test`
4. Create PR with description following our template
5. Request review from your buddy and one other engineer

## Week 2: Database & Infrastructure

### Understanding Data Layer

**Database Schema Study**:
```sql
-- Key tables to understand
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
```

**Important Relationships**:
- Organizations → Users (multi-tenant architecture)
- Organizations → Flows → Executions (workflow hierarchy)
- Flows → Actions → Tools (execution dependencies)

**Study Materials**:
- [Database Schema Documentation](/internal/architecture/database-schema)
- [Multi-Tenant Architecture](/internal/architecture/system-overview#multi-tenant-isolation)

### Infrastructure Components

**Local Development Stack**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml understanding
services:
  postgres:    # Primary database
  redis:       # Caching and sessions
  inngest:     # Job queue for async processing
```

**AWS Production Architecture**:
- **ECS Fargate**: Container orchestration
- **RDS PostgreSQL**: Primary database with read replicas
- **ElastiCache Redis**: Distributed caching
- **ALB + CloudFront**: Load balancing and CDN
- **S3**: Static assets and backup storage

**Study Tasks**:
- Run `docker-compose ps` to see all services
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f postgres`
- Explore Redis keys: `docker exec -it tolstoy_redis redis-cli`
- Review [AWS Architecture](/internal/deployment/infrastructure/aws-architecture)

## Week 3: Feature Development

### Assigned Feature Work

By week 3, you'll be assigned a real feature to implement. Common first features include:

**Example: Add New Action Type**

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Review the feature requirements in Linear
   - Design the action schema and validation rules
   - Plan database changes if needed
   - Discuss approach with your buddy and team lead

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   ```typescript
   // 1. Define the action schema
   interface NewActionSchema {
     type: 'new-action-type';
     inputs: {
       required_field: string;
       optional_field?: number;
     };
   }
   
   // 2. Implement validation
   export class NewActionValidator implements ActionValidator {
     validate(inputs: any): ValidationResult {
       // Implement validation logic
     }
   }
   
   // 3. Implement execution logic
   export class NewActionExecutor implements ActionExecutor {
     async execute(inputs: NewActionSchema['inputs']): Promise<ActionResult> {
       // Implement execution logic
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Write unit tests for validation and execution
   - Write integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
   - Test with real workflows in development environment

4. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples to user documentation
   - Update internal architecture docs if needed

### Code Quality Standards

**Before Submitting PRs**:
```bash
# Run all checks
npm run lint          # ESLint + Prettier
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm test             # Jest unit tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright integration tests
```

**Code Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows our [Coding Standards](/internal/development/guidelines/coding-standards)
- [ ] Tests cover new functionality with >80% coverage
- [ ] Error handling follows established patterns
- [ ] Logging includes appropriate context
- [ ] Documentation updated (API, user, internal)
- [ ] Database migrations are backwards compatible
- [ ] Security implications considered and addressed

## Week 4: Production & Monitoring

### Deployment Process

**Understanding CI/CD Pipeline**:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/`):
   ```yaml
   # Main deployment pipeline
   name: Deploy to Production
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       # Runs tests and linting
     build:
       # Builds Docker images
     deploy:
       # Deploys to AWS ECS
   ```

2. **Deployment Stages**:
   - **Development**: Automatic deployment from `develop` branch
   - **Staging**: Manual promotion from development
   - **Production**: Manual promotion from staging with approval

3. **Rollback Procedures**:
   ```bash
   # Emergency rollback process
   aws ecs update-service \
     --cluster tolstoy-production \
     --service tolstoy-api \
     --task-definition tolstoy-api:previous
   ```

### Monitoring & Observability

**Key Metrics to Understand**:

1. **Application Metrics** (DataDog):
   - Request latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Error rates by endpoint
   - Workflow execution success rates
   - Database query performance

2. **Infrastructure Metrics** (CloudWatch):
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - Database connection counts
   - Cache hit rates
   - Queue processing rates

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - Daily/monthly active workflows
   - Execution volume and trends
   - User engagement metrics

**Alerting Channels**:
- **Critical**: PagerDuty → On-call engineer
- **High**: Slack #alerts channel
