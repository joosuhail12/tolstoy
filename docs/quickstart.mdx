# Quickstart Guide

Get Tolstoy up and running in under 5 minutes and create your first automated workflow.

<Info>
This guide assumes you have Node.js (v18+) and npm installed on your machine.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, let's set up the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# Clone or access your Tolstoy workspace
export TOLSTOY_ORG_ID="your-org-id"
export TOLSTOY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control. Use environment variables or a secure secret management system.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Your First Flow

Create a new file called `hello-world.yaml` with a simple workflow:

```yaml hello-world.yaml
version: 1
name: "Hello World Flow"
description: "A simple workflow to get started"

steps:
  - key: "greeting"
    name: "Send Greeting"
    action: "http.post"
    inputs:
      url: "https://httpbin.org/post"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
      body:
        message: "Hello from Tolstoy!"
        timestamp: "{{now()}}"
    
  - key: "log-result"
    name: "Log the Result"
    action: "console.log"
    inputs:
      message: "Workflow completed successfully!"
      data: "{{steps.greeting.output}}"
```

## Step 3: Deploy Your Flow

Use the Tolstoy CLI to deploy your flow:

```bash
# Install the Tolstoy CLI
npm install -g @tolstoy/cli

# Login to your Tolstoy account
tolstoy auth login

# Deploy your flow
tolstoy deploy hello-world.yaml
```

## Step 4: Execute Your Flow

Now let's run your first workflow:

```bash
# Execute the flow
tolstoy run hello-world --org=$TOLSTOY_ORG_ID

# Monitor execution
tolstoy logs hello-world --follow
```

## Step 5: View Results

Your workflow will execute and you should see output similar to this:

```json
{
  "executionId": "exec-12345",
  "status": "completed",
  "duration": 1240,
  "steps": {
    "greeting": {
      "status": "completed",
      "output": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "data": {
          "message": "Hello from Tolstoy!",
          "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
      }
    },
    "log-result": {
      "status": "completed",
      "output": "Workflow completed successfully!"
    }
  }
}
```
