# Key Features

Tolstoy combines powerful automation capabilities with an intuitive interface, making it easy for teams to build sophisticated workflows without complex infrastructure management.

## üîÑ Flexible Workflow Engine

### Multi-Step Workflows
Create complex workflows with multiple sequential and parallel steps. Each workflow can contain dozens of actions that execute in the exact order you specify.

```yaml
# Example workflow structure
steps:
  - name: "Validate Input"
    action: "validate-data"
  - name: "Process Data"
    action: "transform-data"
    parallel:
      - action: "send-notification"
      - action: "update-database"
  - name: "Send Confirmation"
    action: "email-confirmation"
```

### Conditional Logic
Add sophisticated decision-making to your workflows with conditional execution. Use `executeIf` conditions to create dynamic workflows that adapt based on data and context.

```yaml
- name: "Check Priority"
  action: "evaluate-priority"
- name: "Urgent Notification"
  action: "send-urgent-alert"
  executeIf: "priority == 'high'"
- name: "Standard Processing"
  action: "standard-workflow"
  executeIf: "priority != 'high'"
```

### Error Handling & Retries
Built-in error handling ensures your workflows are resilient. Configure retry policies, timeout settings, and fallback actions to handle edge cases gracefully.

- **Automatic Retries**: Configure exponential backoff and retry limits
- **Error Catching**: Handle specific error types with custom actions
- **Fallback Actions**: Define alternative steps when primary actions fail
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures in complex workflows

## üîå Universal Integrations

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Flexible Authentication
Support for multiple authentication methods ensures you can connect to any service securely:

- **API Keys**: Simple token-based authentication
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authorization flows for third-party services
- **Basic Auth**: Username/password authentication
- **Bearer Tokens**: JWT and similar token formats
- **Custom Headers**: Support for proprietary authentication schemes

### API-First Design
If we don't have a pre-built connector, create your own integration in minutes:

```javascript
// Define a custom tool
{
  "name": "My Custom API",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.myservice.com",
  "authType": "bearer",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

## ‚ö° Execution Modes

### Synchronous Execution
Perfect for real-time workflows that need immediate results. Synchronous execution waits for each step to complete before proceeding to the next.

**Best for:**
- API responses that need immediate results
- Simple workflows with fast-executing steps
- Interactive applications requiring instant feedback

### Asynchronous Execution
Handle long-running workflows without blocking other operations. Asynchronous execution is ideal for complex workflows that may take minutes or hours to complete.

**Best for:**
- Data processing pipelines
- Multi-system integrations
- Workflows with external dependencies
- Batch operations

### Scheduled Execution
Run workflows automatically on a schedule using cron expressions or simple intervals.

```yaml
# Run every day at 9 AM
schedule: "0 9 * * *"

# Run every 15 minutes
schedule: "*/15 * * * *"

# Run on the first day of each month
schedule: "0 0 1 * *"
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Real-Time Execution Tracking
Monitor your workflows as they execute with detailed, real-time visibility:

- **Live Status Updates**: See each step's progress as it happens
- **Execution Metrics**: Track duration, success rates, and performance
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Queue Status**: View pending, running, and completed jobs

### Comprehensive Logging
Every action and decision in your workflows is logged with structured, searchable data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "flowId": "flow_123",
  "executionId": "exec_456",
  "stepName": "send-notification",
  "status": "completed",
  "duration": 250,
  "input": {...},
  "output": {...},
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

### Performance Analytics
Built-in analytics help you optimize your workflows:

- **Success Rate Tracking**: Monitor workflow reliability over time
- **Performance Trends**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Error Analysis**: Understand failure patterns and root causes
- **Usage Metrics**: Track workflow adoption and resource consumption

### Alerting & Notifications
Stay informed about your workflows with flexible alerting:

- **Failure Notifications**: Get notified when workflows fail
- **Performance Alerts**: Monitor SLA breaches and slow executions
- **Custom Webhooks**: Integrate with your existing monitoring stack
- **Multi-Channel Alerts**: Email, Slack, SMS, and more
