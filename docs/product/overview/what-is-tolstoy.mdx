# What is Tolstoy?

Tolstoy is a powerful workflow automation platform designed to help teams and organizations streamline their business processes by connecting different tools, services, and systems. Whether you're automating simple tasks or orchestrating complex multi-step workflows, Tolstoy provides the infrastructure and tools you need to build reliable, scalable automation solutions.

## Core Concept

At its heart, Tolstoy transforms manual, repetitive tasks into automated workflows. Instead of jumping between different applications, copying data, and performing routine operations manually, Tolstoy allows you to define these processes once and execute them automatically whenever needed.

  </Card>

## How It Works

Tolstoy operates on three fundamental building blocks:

### 1. Tools
**Tools** represent external services, APIs, or systems that your workflows interact with. This could be:
- Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Development tools (GitHub, GitLab, Jira)
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Databases and data warehouses
- Custom APIs and internal services

### 2. Actions
**Actions** are reusable components that define specific operations within your tools. For example:
- Send a Slack message
- Create a GitHub issue
- Query a database
- Call a REST API endpoint
- Execute custom code

### 3. Flows
**Flows** are the workflows themselves - sequences of actions that execute in a defined order. Flows can include:
- Sequential steps
- Parallel execution branches  
- Conditional logic (if/then/else)
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Input validation and data transformation

## Real-World Examples

### Development Team Automation

    B --> C{Tests Pass?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Deploy to Staging]
    C -->|No| E[Notify Team in Slack]
    D --> F[Update Jira Ticket]
```

### Customer Support Workflow

    B --> C[Create Support Ticket]
    C --> D[Assign to Team]
    D --> E[Send Confirmation Email]
```

### Data Pipeline

    D --> E[Send Report to Stakeholders]
```

## Key Benefits

### Increased Efficiency
Eliminate manual tasks and reduce time spent on repetitive operations. Teams can focus on high-value work while Tolstoy handles routine processes.

### Improved Reliability
Automated workflows reduce human error and ensure consistent execution. Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling make your processes more resilient.

### Better Integration
Connect disparate systems and tools that don't natively work together. Create seamless data flow across your entire technology stack.

### Scalable Operations
Handle increasing workloads without proportionally increasing manual effort. Tolstoy scales with your business needs.

### Enhanced Visibility
Monitor all your automated processes in one place. Track performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize your workflows over time.
