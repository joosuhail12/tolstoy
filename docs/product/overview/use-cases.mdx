# Use Cases

Tolstoy's flexible architecture makes it perfect for automating workflows across different industries, team sizes, and use cases. Here are some of the most popular ways teams use Tolstoy to streamline their operations.

## 🚀 Development & Engineering

### CI/CD Pipeline Automation

**Problem**: Manual deployment processes are error-prone and time-consuming. Developers spend too much time on operational tasks instead of writing code.

**Solution**: Automate the entire development lifecycle from code commit to production deployment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Push] --> B[Run Tests]
    B --> C{Tests Pass?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Build Docker Image]
    C -->|No| E[Notify Developer]
    D --> F[Deploy to Staging]
    F --> G[Run Integration Tests]
    G --> H{Ready for Production?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Deploy to Production]
    H -->|No| J[Notify QA Team]
    I --> K[Update Monitoring]
    K --> L[Notify Team Success]
```

**Key Actions:**
- **GitHub Integration**: Listen for pull requests and code pushes
- **Test Execution**: Run unit tests, integration tests, and security scans
- **Docker Build**: Create and push container images to registry
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy applications to staging and production
- **Slack Notifications**: Keep teams informed of deployment status

**Results:**
- **80% faster deployments**: Reduce deployment time from hours to minutes
- **95% fewer deployment errors**: Eliminate human mistakes in the process
- **Improved developer experience**: Focus on code, not operations

### Incident Response Automation

**Problem**: When production incidents occur, response time is critical, but manual processes slow down resolution.

**Solution**: Automate incident detection, team notification, and initial response procedures.

```yaml
# Incident Response Workflow
name: "Critical Alert Response"
trigger: "monitoring-webhook"
steps:
  - name: "Parse Alert"
    action: "extract-alert-details"
    
  - name: "Create Incident"
    action: "create-pagerduty-incident"
    inputs:
      severity: "{{alert.severity}}"
      description: "{{alert.message}}"
      
  - name: "Notify On-Call Team"
    action: "send-slack-alert"
    inputs:
      channel: "#incidents"
      message: "🚨 Critical alert: {{alert.service}} is down"
      
  - name: "Start War Room"
    action: "create-zoom-meeting"
    executeIf: "alert.severity == 'critical'"
    
  - name: "Gather Context"
    parallel:
      - action: "fetch-recent-logs"
      - action: "check-system-metrics"
      - action: "query-error-tracking"
```

**Benefits:**
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: Reduce from 15 minutes to 2 minutes
- **Consistent Process**: Ensure the same response procedure every time
- **Context Gathering**: Automatically collect relevant information for faster debugging

    G --> J[Create Support Tickets]
    H --> K[Monitor First Login]
    I --> L[Send Reminder Notifications]
    J --> M[Update Customer Health Score]
```

**Automated Steps:**
1. **Account Provisioning**: Create user accounts in all necessary systems
2. **CRM Integration**: Update Salesforce with customer information and status
3. **Communication**: Send personalized welcome emails and setup guides
4. **Team Coordination**: Assign customer success managers and support contacts

## Need Help Identifying Your Use Case?

If you're not sure how Tolstoy can help your specific situation, consider these questions:

1. **What repetitive tasks does your team perform daily?**
2. **Which processes require coordination across multiple tools or teams?**
3. **Where do manual errors most commonly occur in your workflows?**
4. **What reports or notifications do you create manually on a regular basis?**
5. **Which integrations between systems are currently missing or problematic?**

The answers to these questions often reveal excellent automation opportunities. Start with one small workflow and expand from there as you see the benefits.
