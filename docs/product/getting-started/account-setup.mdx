## Security Best Practices

  <Card title="Use Environment Variables" icon="shield-check">
    Store credentials in environment variables, not in code

### Network Security

**IP Allowlisting**
Configure IP allowlists for additional security if your organization requires it:

```json
{
  "network_policy": {
    "allowed_ips": [
      "203.0.113.0/24",
      "198.51.100.0/24"
    ],
    "webhook_ips": [
      "203.0.113.1"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Webhook Security**
When setting up webhooks, ensure you:
- Use HTTPS endpoints only
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Validate payload structure and content
- Rate limit incoming webhook requests
