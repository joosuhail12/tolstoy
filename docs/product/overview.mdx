## Best Practices & Optimization

### **Workflow Design Principles**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Performance">
    **Optimization Strategies**
    - Use parallel processing where possible
    - Implement efficient error handling
    - Optimize data transformation steps
    - Cache frequently used data
    
    **Resource Management**
    ```json
    {
      "performance_config": {
        "max_concurrent_executions": 10,
        "execution_timeout": "30m",
        "memory_limit": "512MB",
        "retry_strategy": {
          "max_attempts": 3,
          "backoff": "exponential",
          "jitter": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reliability">
    **Error Handling**
    - Implement comprehensive error handling
    - Use circuit breakers for external services
    - Design for eventual consistency
    - Plan for partial failures
    
    **Monitoring Best Practices**
    ```typescript
    // Set up comprehensive monitoring
    await client.flows.update(flowId, {
      monitoring: {
        alerts: [
          {
            condition: 'execution_time > 5m',
            action: 'notify_team'
          },
          {
            condition: 'failure_rate > 5%',
            action: 'escalate_oncall'
          }
        ],
        metrics: ['execution_time', 'success_rate', 'resource_usage']
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Security">
    **Security Best Practices**
    - Use least privilege access principles
    - Implement proper secret management
    - Regular security audits and reviews
    - Monitor for anomalous activity
    
    **Data Protection**
    ```json
    {
      "security_config": {
        "data_encryption": {
          "at_rest": true,
          "in_transit": true,
          "key_rotation": "90d"
        },
        "access_control": {
          "require_mfa": true,
          "session_timeout": "8h",
          "ip_whitelist": ["10.0.0.0/8"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Scaling Considerations**

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Design stateless workflows
- Use message queues for decoupling
- Implement proper load balancing
- Plan for multi-region deployment

**Performance Optimization:**
- Profile workflow execution regularly
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Use caching strategically
- Monitor resource utilization patterns
