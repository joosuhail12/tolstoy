# Quickstart

Get started with Tolstoy, the enterprise workflow automation platform. This guide will walk you through creating your first workflow in under 10 minutes.

## What is Tolstoy?

Tolstoy is a powerful workflow automation platform that enables you to:
- **Connect APIs**: Integrate with external services and tools
- **Build Workflows**: Create complex, multi-step business processes
- **Execute Securely**: Run workflows with monitoring and error handling
- **Scale Enterprise**: Multi-tenant architecture with comprehensive logging

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- An active Tolstoy organization account
- API credentials for any external services you want to integrate
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and JSON

## Step 1: Set Up Authentication

First, you'll need to set up API authentication headers for all requests:

```bash
export TOLSTOY_ORG_ID="your-organization-id"
export TOLSTOY_USER_ID="your-user-id"
```

All API requests require these headers:
```
x-org-id: your-organization-id
x-user-id: your-user-id
```

## Step 2: Create a Tool Integration

Register an external API service that your workflows will interact with:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/tools \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "GitHub API",
    "baseUrl": "https://api.github.com",
    "authType": "bearer"
  }'
```

## Step 3: Define an Action

Create a reusable action that defines a specific API operation:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/actions \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "github-get-user",
    "name": "Get GitHub User",
    "toolId": "<tool-id-from-step-2>",
    "method": "GET",
    "endpoint": "/users/{username}",
    "inputSchema": [
      {
        "name": "username",
        "type": "string",
        "required": true,
        "description": "GitHub username"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Step 4: Create Your First Flow

Now create a workflow that uses your action:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/flows \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Workflow",
    "version": 1,
    "steps": [
      {
        "key": "get-user",
        "action": "github-get-user",
        "inputs": {
          "username": "octocat"
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Step 5: Execute the Flow

Run your workflow and see it in action:

```bash
curl -X POST https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/flows/{flow-id}/execute \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mode": "sync"
  }'
```

## Step 6: Monitor Execution

Check the execution status and logs:

```bash
# Get execution status
curl https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/flows/{flow-id}/executions/{execution-id} \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID"

# View execution logs
curl https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/execution-logs?executionId={execution-id} \
  -H "x-org-id: $TOLSTOY_ORG_ID" \
  -H "x-user-id: $TOLSTOY_USER_ID"
```

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've successfully:
- Created your first Tool integration
- Defined a reusable Action
- Built and executed a workflow
- Monitored execution results

## What You Can Do Next

### Build More Complex Workflows
- **Multi-Step Flows**: Chain multiple actions together
- **Conditional Logic**: Use `executeIf` conditions to control flow
- **Error Handling**: Set up retry policies and failure handling
- **Webhooks**: Get notified when workflows complete

### Advanced Features
- **Durable Execution**: Use async mode for long-running workflows
- **Code Execution**: Run custom JavaScript/Python in secure sandboxes
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Connect to WebSocket updates for live progress
- **Metrics & Analytics**: Track performance and success rates

### Integration Examples
- **GitHub + Slack**: Auto-notify team when PRs are created
- **CRM + Email**: Send welcome emails for new customers
- **Database + Analytics**: Generate and send weekly reports
- **Support + Ticketing**: Auto-create tickets from form submissions
