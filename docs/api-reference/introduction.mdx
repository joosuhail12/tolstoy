# Tolstoy API

The Tolstoy API allows you to programmatically manage flows, actions, executions, and all other resources in your Tolstoy organization. Our API is built around REST principles and uses standard HTTP methods, status codes, and authentication.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1
```

## Authentication

The Tolstoy API uses Bearer token authentication. You can generate API keys from your dashboard:

```bash
# Include your API key in the Authorization header
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
     https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1/flows
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## Request Format

### Headers

All requests should include these headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
X-Org-ID: your-organization-id
```

### Request Body

For POST and PUT requests, send data as JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "My Flow",
  "version": 1,
  "steps": [...]
}
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "flow-123",
    "name": "My Flow",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req-abc123"
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid flow definition",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "steps",
        "message": "At least one step is required"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "request_id": "req-abc123"
  }
}
```

## Status Codes

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 201 | Created |
| 400 | Bad Request |
| 401 | Unauthorized |
| 403 | Forbidden |
| 404 | Not Found |
| 409 | Conflict |
| 422 | Validation Error |
| 429 | Rate Limited |
| 500 | Internal Error |

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to prevent abuse:

- **Standard Plan**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Pro Plan**: 10,000 requests per hour  
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642248000
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination using query parameters:

```bash
curl "https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1/flows?page=2&limit=50"
```

Pagination response includes metadata:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 2,
    "limit": 50,
    "total": 150,
    "pages": 3,
    "has_next": true,
    "has_prev": true
  }
}
```

## Filtering and Sorting

Most list endpoints support filtering and sorting:

```bash
# Filter by status
curl "https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1/flows?status=active"

# Sort by creation date
curl "https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1/flows?sort=created_at&order=desc"

# Combine filters
curl "https://tolstoy.getpullse.com/v1/flows?status=active&tags=production&sort=name"
```

## Webhooks

Tolstoy can send webhooks for various events. Configure webhooks in your dashboard or via the API:

```json
{
  "url": "https://your-app.com/webhooks/tolstoy",
  "events": ["flow.completed", "flow.failed"],
  "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
}
```

Webhook payloads include:

```json
{
  "event": "flow.completed",
  "data": {
    "flow_id": "flow-123",
    "execution_id": "exec-456",
    "status": "completed",
    "duration": 1240
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## SDKs

Official SDKs are available for popular languages:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Node.js
const { Tolstoy } = require('@tolstoy/sdk');

const client = new Tolstoy({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  orgId: 'your-org-id'
});

const flows = await client.flows.list();
```

```python Python
from tolstoy import Tolstoy

client = Tolstoy(
    api_key='your-api-key',
    org_id='your-org-id'
)

flows = client.flows.list()
```

```go Go
import "github.com/tolstoy-dev/sdk-go"

client := tolstoy.NewClient("your-api-key", "your-org-id")
flows, err := client.Flows.List(context.Background())
```

```php PHP
use Tolstoy\Client;

$client = new Client('your-api-key', 'your-org-id');
$flows = $client->flows->list();
```
