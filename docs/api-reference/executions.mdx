# Executions API

The Executions API allows you to monitor, manage, and retrieve information about workflow executions. When you execute a flow, it creates an execution record that tracks the progress and results of each step.

## Execution Object

An execution represents a single run of a workflow with specific inputs.

### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the execution |
| `flow_id` | string | ID of the flow being executed |
| `status` | enum | Current status (`queued`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) |
| `inputs` | object | Input parameters provided to the execution |
| `outputs` | object | Final outputs from the execution (available when completed) |
| `steps` | array | Array of step execution details |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When the execution was started |
| `completed_at` | timestamp | When the execution finished (null if still running) |

## Get an Execution

Retrieve details of a specific execution.

```bash
curl https://api.tolstoy.dev/v1/executions/exec_1234567890 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_..."
```

## List Executions

Retrieve a list of executions with optional filtering.

```bash
curl https://api.tolstoy.dev/v1/executions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_..."
```

## Cancel an Execution

Stop a running execution.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tolstoy.dev/v1/executions/exec_1234567890/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_..."
```

## Stream Execution Updates

Get real-time updates for an execution using Server-Sent Events.

```bash
curl https://api.tolstoy.dev/v1/executions/exec_1234567890/stream \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_..."
```
